TypecastTime
============

In a web application its necessary to save epoch time in database and show the same time in human readable format in view page.
But this is taking huge effort to convert the time to the desired format. This plugin simplifies that effort and simplifies the reading and writing of epoch time.
Below example helps us to understand better


Example
=======

Lets assume that we have 2 different epoch time in our coupons table. for example start_date and end_date


Class Coupon < ActiveRecord::Base
typecast_time :start_time, end_time, :format => ["%d", " ", "%b", " ", "%y", " ", "%I", ":", "%M", " ", "%p"]
end

The default format is ["%d", " ", "%b", " ", "%y"]

When you need the orginal epoch time in some place of your code then use the following method to get the orginal epoch time

start_time_before_typecast_time("start_time).to_i

So with this you can safely save your epoch time in db and show the readable format in html view page.
